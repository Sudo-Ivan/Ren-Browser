I welcome all contributions to the project.

## Places to help out

- Styling/Design (I am bad at this)
- Documentation

## Rules

1. Be nice to each other.
2. If you use an AI tool that generates the code, such as a LLM, please indicate that in the PR.
3. Add or update docstrings and tests if necessary.
4. Make sure you run the tests before submitting the PR.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
